# automated_typer

This is an AI for NitroType and similar browser games.
The script reads in WS messages and filters it for the typing text.
It will automatically type the text out based on user input speed.

Speed and accuracy can be randomized using a standard deviation to avoid detection.

Script is meant to be a proof of concept and not a means to actively gain the system.
